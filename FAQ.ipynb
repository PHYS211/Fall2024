Specifically, read [this article about how LLMs actually work](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/07/03/do-large-language-models-know-what-they-are-talking-about/) and [this article about the ethical considerations around LLMs](https://montrealethics.ai/what-lies-behind-agi-ethical-concerns-related-to-llms/)\n",

        "\n",
        "Remember that LLMs are designed to predict the most probable response to a question, which is not always the best or even correct response. They are prone to \"hallucinating\" (making stuff up, often in a way that is convincing but still false). They can't do creative problem solving, which is the most important skill we are teaching in this class.\n",

Their role is to support students seeking help with time management, organization, reading, test-taking, note-taking, and other academic skills.

However, I don't expect to have done this perfectly (as there is no such thing), so if you have need of certain accommodations that are not already provided by this class, please let me know and I will do my best to meet those needs.\n",
